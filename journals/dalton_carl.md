# Week 1
The initial design and concept of the app was created. We used excel draw to begin a wireframe for our project. Working with my team we were able to finalize our project name, MVP, and explore what parts we each feel comfortable tackling. Once the wireframe was done, a Trello was built and google docs were updated to reflect needed endpoints. We planned to begin coding by the end of the first week, but the refactoring of our MVP went into the end of Friday, based on instructor feedback we scaled down our project.

# Week 2 + Summer Break
Pair programming was happening during this week to establish endpoints and create most of the back-end code. This was done mostly as a collective group with one person being the "live coder" for the group each day. Working through the problems, creating tables and migrations as required to flush out the data we will be using. We got the initial docker up and running to test on localhost:8000/docs and begin hitting end-points.

During the holiday break week, Diana and I met up to complete auth to a workable point. Getting front-end auth working was achieved, but had a few errors that were happening randomly. Those issues were resolved by Ian by the end of the week once we got the branch updated and notified the team of our progress.

# Week 3
We continued to do a lot of group programming but were able to break into separate teams to work on a few features. We wanted to ensure everyone understood the code before working on their own. I could begin to create the front-end pages by setting up the layouts and moving forward with general idea for layout.

# Week 4
Also created my own end-point to hit on the front end. Allowing us to update an employee status which is used in some cases. Me and Rosanna finished the employee portal and employee signup page. We wanted to ensure a regular user could not access the employee login page. Putting it behind a code "code" allowed us to do that. If a regular user somehow finds their way to the employee login page and logins in, they will be forced to log out and notified they are in the wrong area of the site. Spent time going through GitLab and ensuring we have correct labels for issues and merges, looking for merges of my own that I did not fully fill out to meet rubric requirements. Refactored the login page to use local storage of userData so that it carries over when refreshing or entering a webpage through a non-navbar link.

# Week 5
Worked to finish completing all the required pages to be used on the front end. A lot of this week was spent correcting deployment issues we encountered with our URLs for endpoints and web pages. We worked together through LiveShare in VSCODE to create and update the readme. This feature was also used to continue the cleanup of old code that is no longer needed. Worked to finalize the employee list page to show both the entire list of employees and those with a current ride. This used an endpoint of my own and one of Rosanna's.
