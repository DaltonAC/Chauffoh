# Week 1
Inital design and concept of the app was created. We used exceldraw to begin a wireframe for our project. Working with my team we were able to finialize our project name, MVP, and explore what parts we each feel comfortable tackling. Once the wireframe was done, a Trello was built and google docs was updated to reflect needed endpoints. We planned to begin coding by the end of the first week, but the refactoring of our MVP went into the end of Friday, based on instructor feedback we scaled down our project.

# Week 2 + Summer Break
Pair programming was happening during this week to establish end-points and create the majority of the back-end code to begin. This was done mostly as a collective group with one person being the "live coder" for the group each day. Working through the problems, creating tables and migrations as required to flush out the data we will be using. We got the inital docker up and running as to test on localhost:8000/docs and begin to hit end-points.

During the holiday break week, Diana and I met up to complete auth to a workable point. Getting front-end auth working was achieved, but had a few errors that were happening randomyl. Those issues which were resolved by Ian by the end of the week once we got the branch updated and notified the team of our progress.

# Week 3 
We contiuned to do a lot of group programming, but were able to break into seperate teams to work on a few features. We wanted to ensure everyone understood the code before working on their own. I was able to begin to create the front-end pages by getting the layouts set up and moving forward with general idea for layout. 

# Week 4
Also created my own end-point to hit on the front-end. Allowing us to update an employee status which is used in some cases. Me and Rosanna finished the employee portal and employee signup page. We wanted to ensure a regular user could not access the employee login page. Putting it behind a code "code" allowed us to do that. If a regular user some how finds their way to the employee login page and logins in, they will be forced logged out and notified they are in the wrong area of the site. Spent time going through gitlab and ensuring we have correct labels for issues and merges, looking for merges of my own I did not fully fill out to meet rubric requirements. Refactoered the login page to use localstorage of userData so that it carrys over when refreshing or entering a webpage through a non-navbar link. 

# Week 5
Worked to finish completing all the required pages to be used on the front-end. A lot of this week was spent correcting deployment issues we encountered with our URLs for endpoints and webpages.
