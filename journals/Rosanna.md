# Week of June 26th

As a group we set up the database, including some initial tables and dummy data. Set up beekeper. We also set up front and back-end auth and got the sign-up page set up.

# Week of July 10th

As a group we created more endpoints and modified some to have joins where necessary. 

We also added a lot of front end-functionality, some as a group and some seperately.

I did my first merge request to add the functionality to have a receipt be created when I ride is requested.

# Week of July 17th

More front end work. I added an endpoint to list all employees, and also did the front end work to add this as a component of the employee dashboard. 

I also added the backend and front end functionality to be able to edit user account details, plus an account view page on the front end.

Began work on changing the navbar so it would render differently depending on whether a user is logged in or not.

# Week of July 24th

Completed unit test. Worked on styling, fixed some front end bugs and wrote the README.
